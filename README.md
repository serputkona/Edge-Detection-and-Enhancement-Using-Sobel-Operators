# Edge Detection and Enhancement Using Sobel Operators

This repository focuses on edge detection and image enhancement and includes the following components:

## Edge Detection with Sobel Operators

- **Sobel Operator [3x3]**: Detects edges in the `cameraman.tif` image using the 3x3 Sobel operator to highlight boundaries and transitions.
- **Sobel Operator [5x5]**: Detects edges in the `cameraman.tif` image using the 5x5 Sobel operator for a more refined edge detection.

## Histogram Equalization

- **Equalization**: Applies histogram equalization to the `cameraman.tif` image to improve contrast and determine the inflection points of the equalization function.

## Edge Detection in Enhanced Image

- **Enhanced Image**: Detects edges in the histogram-equalized image using the Sobel operator [3x3] to assess the impact of contrast enhancement on edge detection.
