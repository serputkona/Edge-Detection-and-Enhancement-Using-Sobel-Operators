# Edge-Detection-and-Enhancement-Using-Sobel-Operators
This repository focuses on edge detection and image enhancement and includes:

1. Detecting edges in the cameraman.tif image using the Sobel operator [3x3].
2. Detecting edges in the cameraman.tif image using the Sobel operator [5x5].
3. Applying histogram equalization to the cameraman.tif image to determine the inflection points of the equalization function.
4. Detecting edges in the enhanced image using the Sobel operator [3x3].
